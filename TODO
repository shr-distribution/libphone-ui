* document utility (and non utility, but mostly utility) functions
* consider lodaing utilityl functions from modules as well (an opimd module and an alsa module to start with)
* drop all the g_slice0
* typedef all the callback functions we provide 
* add phoneui_deinit
* move the screens init to libphone-ui instead of the phoneui-*.c in backends and then make screen caching configurable
